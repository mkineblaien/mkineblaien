## Software Engineer | Frontend-Focused (React, React Native, TypeScript) | Backend Experience | Building AI-Powered Products from 0→1

---

Senior Frontend & Mobile Engineer with extensive experience building and scaling large production applications using React.js, React Native, Next.js, and TypeScript. Proven track record in fast-paced startup environments, shipping impactful features quickly while maintaining long-term scalability and quality. Comfortable jumping across the stack—from frontend to API layer (Node.js, Express.js, NestJS), working with databases (Postgres, MongoDB), through to deployments and infrastructure (Docker, AWS, DigitalOcean), and CI/CD automation (GitHub Actions).

I bring a strong product sense, sweating UX details and ensuring polished, intuitive experiences that drive adoption and retention. Known for a bias toward clarity, I can navigate messy backlogs, prioritize effectively, and turn ambiguous requirements into actionable solutions. Skilled at leading teams, collaborating across engineering, design, and product, and delivering outcomes that directly improve business metrics such as customer satisfaction, engagement, and revenue growth.
